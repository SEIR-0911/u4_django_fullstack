## SEIR 0911 Django Full Stack Build

# Tick-iT
### The modern way to purchase event tickets


With our Django REST API lab done we have completed all of the lessons for our cohort. By now you are hopefully thinking of what you'd like to build for your Capstone project, both in the content of the project, and which frameworks you want to use to build it up. We have seen the steps required to set up a Convential Relational Database using Python, and using the REST Framework app to convert it into JSON data. It may seem simple at first, but there are a lot of steps that can make it more difficult than you may think.

For our final lab, we will build up a REST-ful API using Django, and attach it to a front-end built in  React.

## Background

As you may know, Ticketmaster is awful. Adding 30% service fees to a sale may seem like a great business model, but might actually be turning away potential customers. Luckily, we can use this to our advantage, and take a bit of their market share with our new Tick-iT website. 

## Requirements

For this webpage you will create a list of local venues, each of which have a number of events belonging to them. Then, using whichever JS framework you choose, plus the Axios library, lets Get those venues and events and render them on our screen in a clean, professionally styled, user-friendly webpage.

You will need :

- A newly created Github Repo for Front and Back Ends
- At least 4 Back end paths (Index and Show of Venues and Events at each venue)
- A functioning SPA built with React, or with Django Views
- A front-end Router that has a landing page with each Venue, with clickable links to see the individal shows belonging to each
- At least 1 additional route of Create, Update, or Delete for at least 1 of your models


We will be presenting our projects Thursday 4/6 11AM EST
